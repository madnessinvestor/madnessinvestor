## 👋 Hey everyone, how’s it going?

I’m **madnessinvestor**, also known as **eMadness**.  

I’m a **beginner builder** and **crypto content creator**, passionate about learning and building projects — all of them are available here on GitHub.

Furthermore, I create content about **cryptocurrencies in general**. I started my journey with **Ethereum mining back in 2016**. After the transition from **Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS)**, I left my GPUs behind and ventured deeper into the **crypto market and the Web3 ecosystem**.

I am currently exploring Web 3 as a whole, innovating new projects, building dApps, and learning more and more. 🚀
